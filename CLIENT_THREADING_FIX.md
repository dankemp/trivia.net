## Current Test Results

```
==========================================
  Trivia.NET Client-Output Test Suite
==========================================

TEST 1: Client displays READY message        ✗ FAIL
TEST 2: Client displays QUESTION message     ✗ FAIL
TEST 3: Client displays RESULT feedback      ✗ FAIL
TEST 4: Complete game flow (manual mode)     ✗ FAIL

TEST 6: Connection failure handling          ✓ PASS

Total: 1/6 passing (16.7%)
```

## The Problem

**Test 6 passes** because it tests connection failure (no threading involved).

**Tests 1-5 fail** due to a **race condition** in your client's threading implementation.

### What's Happening:

1. Client reads from stdin: `CONNECT localhost:8001`
2. Client connects and starts **daemon thread** to handle server messages
3. Client **immediately** reads next line: `DISCONNECT` or `EXIT`
4. Client calls `sys.exit(0)` in main thread
5. **Program exits before daemon thread receives/prints any messages**

### Evidence:

All failing tests produce **empty output files**:
```bash
$ ls -lh tests/client_tests/actual/
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Oct 27 01:06 test_01.actual  # Empty!
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Oct 27 01:06 test_02.actual  # Empty!
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Oct 27 01:06 test_03.actual  # Empty!
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Oct 27 01:06 test_04.actual  # Empty!
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Oct 27 01:06 test_05.actual  # Empty!
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18 Oct 27 01:06 test_06.actual  # Has output!
```

## The Fix

You need to ensure the main thread waits for the daemon thread to process messages before exiting.

### Solution 1: Add Sleep After Starting Thread (Quick & Easy)

In `client.py`, modify the `handle_command()` function:

```python
# Current code (around line 232):
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_server_messages, daemon=True)
server_thread.start()

# FIX: Add sleep to give thread time to start and receive messages
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_server_messages, daemon=True)
server_thread.start()
time.sleep(0.1)  # Give thread time to start receiving messages
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple one-line fix
- ✅ Works for automated tests

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Arbitrary delay (may need adjustment)
- ⚠️ Not elegant

### Solution 2: Use Event for Synchronization (Better)

Add proper synchronization using `threading.Event`:

```python
import threading

# At module level, add:
first_message_received = threading.Event()

# In handle_received_message(), at the very start:
def handle_received_message(message: dict[str, Any]):
    global first_message_received

    # Signal that we've received at least one message
    if not first_message_received.is_set():
        first_message_received.set()

    # ... rest of your code

# In handle_command(), after starting thread:
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_server_messages, daemon=True)
server_thread.start()

# Wait for at least one message before allowing commands to continue
# This ensures READY message is received before DISCONNECT can happen
first_message_received.wait(timeout=5)  # Wait up to 5 seconds
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Proper synchronization
- ✅ No arbitrary delays
- ✅ More robust

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Slightly more complex

### Solution 3: Don't Use Daemon Thread (Most Robust)

Make the thread non-daemon and join it properly:

```python
# Change daemon=True to daemon=False
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_server_messages, daemon=False)
server_thread.start()

# In DISCONNECT and EXIT handlers, before sys.exit():
if connected and server_thread:
    connected = False  # This will make the thread exit its while loop
    server_thread.join(timeout=2)  # Wait for thread to finish
    sys.exit(0)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Most correct approach
- ✅ Ensures all messages are processed
- ✅ Clean shutdown

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires more code changes

## Testing Your Fix

After implementing any of the solutions above:

```bash
# Run tests
bash tests/client_tests/run_client_tests.sh

# Expected result:
# All 6 tests should PASS ✓
```

## Why This Matters for Manual Testing

You might wonder: "The client works fine when I use it manually, why do I need to fix this?"

**Answer:** When you manually type commands in the terminal, there's a **natural delay** between:
1. Typing `CONNECT localhost:7777`
2. Typing `DISCONNECT`

This delay gives the daemon thread plenty of time to receive and print messages. But in **automated tests**, commands are read instantly from a file with no delay, exposing the race condition.

## Verification

To verify the issue exists, try this manual test:

```bash
# Start server
python3 server.py --config server_config.json &

# Create instant commands (no delay)
echo -e "CONNECT localhost:7777\nDISCONNECT\nEXIT" | python3 client.py --config client_manual_config.json

# You'll likely see NO output (same as the tests)

# Now try with delays (simulating manual typing)
(
  echo "CONNECT localhost:7777"
  sleep 2
  echo "DISCONNECT"
  sleep 1
  echo "EXIT"
) | python3 client.py --config client_manual_config.json

# You'll likely see READY and QUESTION messages (works!)
```

## Recommended Fix

I recommend **Solution 1** (add sleep) for now because:
- ✅ One line change
- ✅ Tests will immediately pass
- ✅ Can refine later if needed

Then, if you have time, upgrade to **Solution 2** or **Solution 3** for a more robust implementation.

## After the Fix

Once you fix this issue:
1. ✅ All 6 tests should pass
2. ✅ You'll have a complete, working test suite
3. ✅ Tests satisfy assignment requirements
4. ✅ Ready for submission!

---

**Bottom Line:** This is a classic threading race condition. Your client works manually but fails in automated tests because of timing. Add synchronization to fix it.
